What is African Bitcoin?
----------------

African Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. African Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. African Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the African Bitcoin Core software, see http://african.nationalbitcoin.org/.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/nationalbitcoin/africanbitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of African Bitcoin Core.
